                 DNS Extensions for Proxying IP in HTTP
              draft-schinazi-masque-connect-ip-dns-latest

Abstract

   Proxying IP in HTTP allows building a VPN through HTTP load
   balancers.  However, at the time of writing, that mechanism doesn't
   offer a mechanism for communicating DNS information inline.  In
   contrast, most existing VPN protocols provide a mechanism to exchange
   DNS configuration information.  This document describes an extension
   that exchanges this information using HTTP capsules.

1.  Introduction

   Proxying IP in HTTP ([CONNECT-IP]) allows building a VPN through HTTP
   load balancers.  However, at the time of writing, that mechanism
   doesn't offer a mechanism for communicating DNS information inline.
   In contrast, most existing VPN protocols provide a mechanism to
   exchange DNS configuration information (e.g., [IKEv2]).  This
   document describes an extension that exchanges this information using
   HTTP capsules ([HTTP-DGRAM]).

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Mechanism

   Similar to how Proxying IP in HTTP exchanges IP addresses
   (Section 4.7 of [CONNECT-IP]), this mechanism leverages capsules to
   request configuration and to assign it.  Similarly, this mechanism is
   bidirectional: either endpoint can request DNS configuration by
   sending a DNS_REQUEST capsule, and either endpoint can send DNS
   configuration in a DNS_ASSIGN capsule.  These capsules follow the
   format defined below.

   Nameserver Address {
     IP Version (8),
     IP Address (32..128),
   }

                    Figure 1: Nameserver Address Format

   Each Nameserver Address contains the following fields:

   IP Version:  IP Version of this nameserver address, encoded as an
      unsigned 8-bit integer.  It MUST be either 4 or 6.

   IP Address:  DNS nameserver IP address.  If the IP Version field has
      value 4, the IP Address field SHALL have a length of 32 bits.  If
      the IP Version field has value 6, the IP Address field SHALL have
      a length of 128 bits.

   Domain {
     Domain Length (i),
     Domain Name (..),
   }

                      Figure 2: Internal Domain Format

   Each Domain contains the following fields:

   Domain Length:  Length of the following Domain field, encoded as a
      variable-length integer.

   Domain Name:  Fully Qualified Domain Name in DNS presentation format
      and using an Internationalized Domain Names for Applications
      (IDNA) A-label ([IDNA]).

   DNS Configuration {
     Request ID (i),
     Nameserver Address Count (i),
     Nameserver Address (..) ...,
     Internal Domain Count (i),
     Internal Domain (..) ...,
     Search Domain Count (i),
     Search Domain (..) ...,
   }

                     Figure 3: Assigned Address Format

   Each DNS Configuration contains the following fields:

   Request ID:
      Request identifier, encoded as a variable-length integer.  If this
      DNS Configuration is part of a request, then this contains a
      unique request identifier.  If this DNS configuration is part of
      an assignment that is in response to a DNS configuration request
      then this field SHALL contain the value of the corresponding field
      in the request.  If this DNS configuration is part of an
      unsolicited assignment, this field SHALL be zero.

   Nameserver Address Count:
      The number of Nameserver Address structures following this field.
      Encoded as a variable-length integer.

   Nameserver Address:
      A series of Nameserver Address structures representing DNS name
      servers.

   Internal Domain Count:
      The number of Domain structures following this field.  Encoded as
      a variable-length integer.

   Internal Domain:
      A series of Domain structures representing internal DNS names.

   Search Domain Count:
      The number of Domain structures following this field.  Encoded as
      a variable-length integer.

   Search Domain:
      A series of Domain structures representing search domains.

2.1.  DNS_REQUEST Capsule

   The DNS_REQUEST capsule (see Section 5 for the value of the capsule
   type) allows an endpoint to request DNS configuration from its peer.
   The capsule allows the endpoint to optionally indicate a preference
   for which DNS configuration it would get assigned.  The sender can
   indicate that it has no preference by not sending any addresses or
   names in its request DNS Configuration.

   DNS_REQUEST Capsule {
     Type (i) = DNS_REQUEST,
     Length (i),
     DNS Configuration (..),
   }

                    Figure 4: DNS_REQUEST Capsule Format

   When sending a DNS_REQUEST capsule, the sender MUST generate and send
   a new non-zero request ID that was not previously used on this IP
   Proxying stream.

   An endpoint that receives a DNS_REQUEST capsule SHALL reply by
   sending a DNS_ASSIGN capsule with the corresponding request ID.  That
   DNS_ASSIGN capsule MAY be empty, that indicates that its sender has
   no DNS configuration to share with its peer.

2.2.  DNS_ASSIGN Capsule

   The DNS_ASSIGN capsule (see Section 5 for the value of the capsule
   type) allows an endpoint to send DNS configuration to its peer.

   DNS_ASSIGN Capsule {
     Type (i) = DNS_ASSIGN,
     Length (i),
     DNS Configuration (..),
   }

                    Figure 5: DNS_ASSIGN Capsule Format

   When sending a DNS_ASSIGN capsule in response to a received
   DNS_REQUEST capsule, the Request ID field in the DNS_ASSIGN capsule
   SHALL be set to the value in the received DNS_REQUEST capsule.
   Otherwise the request ID MUST be set to zero.

3.  Handling

   Note that internal domains include subdomains.  In other words, if
   the DNS configuration contains a domain, that indicates that the
   corresponding domain and all of its subdomains can be resolved by the
   nameservers exchanged in the same DNS configuration.

   As with other IP Proxying capsules, the receiver can decide to
   whether to use or ignore the configuration information.  For example,
   in the consumer VPN scenario, clients will trust the server and apply
   received DNS configuration, whereas servers will ignore any DNS
   configuration sent by the client.

4.  Security Considerations

   Acting on received DNS_ASSIGN capsules can have significant impact on
   endpoint security.  Endpoints MUST ignore DNS_ASSIGN capsules unless
   it has reason to trust its peer and is expecting DNS configuration
   from it.

   The requirement for an endpoint to always send DNS_ASSIGN capsules in
   response to DNS_REQUEST capsules could lead it to buffer unbounded
   amounts of memory if the underlying stream is blocked by flow or
   congestion control.  Implementations MUST place an upper bound on
   that buffering and abort the stream if that limit is reached.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document, if approved, will request IANA add the following
   values to the "HTTP Capsule Types" registry maintained at
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/masque>.

                       +============+==============+
                       | Value      | Capsule Type |
                       +============+==============+
                       | 0x2B40144C | DNS_ASSIGN   |
                       +------------+--------------+
                       | 0x2B40144D | DNS_REQUEST  |
                       +------------+--------------+

                           Table 1: New Capsules

   Note that, if this document is approved, the values defined above
   will be replaced by smaller ones before publication.

   All of these new entries use the following values for these fields:
